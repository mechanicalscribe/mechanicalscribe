				<div class="title">Overview</div>	
				<div>I'm a data journalist with 15 years of professional experience as both a reporter and a computer programmer. My specialty is researching and producing interactive graphics based on large datasets. I typically execute every stage of a project, from collecting the data, composing the statistical code to analyze it, conducting interviews based on the findings, writing an accompanying article, and developing user-friendly, interactive visualizations to make the data come alive. I am the author of O'Reilly's (now somewhat-dated) <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029601.do" target="_self">manual on RaphaelJS.</a></div>

				<div class="title">Technical Skills</div>
					My strongest languages are JavaScript (ES6 and backward compliance), Node.js, Python, R and Mathematica. I'm well-versed in all modern JavaScript visualization libraries, such as D3.js, Three.js and Canvas, as well as the JavaScript development pipeline for using tools like Webkit to optimize code. On the database side, I typically use MonogDB or MySQL but have experience in several others.
