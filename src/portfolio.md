                This is my most ambitious coding project. Rather than precalculate the position of the Sun and the Moon for all 70,000+ locations&mdash;which requires sophisticated astrophysics&mdash;I modeled the Sun, Earth and Moon in <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>, then used the camera location to make the interactive location-specific. The results were rigorously fact-checked against NASA's demos and worked out fantastically!

                I love experimenting with new technologies that people are not accustomed to see on a news website. This project, like our <a href="http://time.com/4635763/national-handwriting-day-cursive-letters/" target="_blank">"Can You Remember Cursive?" Quiz</a> and our <a href="http://time.com/3743739/company-logo-quiz/" target="_blank">Draw the Logo From Memory Quiz</a> uses a sophisticated in-house algorithm to compare how users' drawings&mdash;whether with a mouse or a finger&mdash;match the correct shape.

                We took a scientific approach to the typical quiz: In partnership with social scientists from Cambridge University, we used an empirical personality survey to place users in one of the four Hogwarts houses. Users could opt-in to contributing their responses to the researchers, who study the geographic distribution of personality. We were able to provide nearly 100,000 participants to their study in addition to getting a feature that brought in millions of page views and stood above your typical online quiz.

                The data that generated this interactive was a rigorous analysis of several million Census records extracted from <a href="https://usa.ipums.org/usa/" target="_blank">IPUMS</a>, a clearinghouse for Census micro-records that allows for sophisticated analyses and cross-tabulations of several hundred variables. I have used it for many projects.

                While not a cheerful topic, I was proud to break this story on how the CDC irregularly classifies overdoes from opioids, using several years of granular data from the <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">CDC WONDER database</a> combined with interviews with experts.

                I love partnering with third-party companies to analyze their data and produce articles that would otherwise be impossible to calculate using publicly available data&mdash;even if the end project is a tad whimsical. Here, GrubHub generously provided TIME with reams of anonymous data on what sorts of foods people order by location, which we cross-referenced with Congressional districts.
